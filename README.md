### Strategy Plane

The Quiz Website was created to highlight my combined knowledge of HTML, CSS and JAvaScript while also providing the websites users with an engaging and challenging multiple choice game. The questions themselves will be generated and retrieved from the Open Triva Database which allows the use of a free JSON API for use in programming projects.
The game should be intuitive and easy to interact with, while also providing some feedback to the user when the game is finished.

Goals:

* Present the knowledge acquired in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Give website users an interactive game experience.
