### Strategy Plane

The Quiz Website was created to highlight my combined knowledge of HTML, CSS and JAvaScript while also providing the websites users with an engaging and challenging multiple choice game. The questions themselves will be generated and retrieved from the Open Triva Database which allows the use of a free JSON API for use in programming projects.
The game should be intuitive and easy to interact with, while also providing some feedback to the user when the game is finished.

Goals:

* Present the knowledge acquired in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Give website users an interactive game experience.
* Create a website that will make the user want to stay on the website to beat their personal best score. 

#### User Stories

* As a user, I want to:
    * Understand the purpose of the site on landing.
    * Be able to use the website clearly in the browser.
    * Have a form of game instructions.
    * Have a form of in-game feedback on correct/incorrect answers.
    * Be able to restart the game when the current one has ended.
    * Get a score total for the number of correct answers selected of the total pool of qiestions asked.
